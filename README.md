# aws_terraform_amos
AWS Terraform code for creating server infrastructer and installing packages 
with instructions for setting up keys, security groups, and permissions in AWS

#provision a user that terraform can use to access AWS:
Note your AWS account id - you will need it to log in from the AWS console
Go to AWS, IAM, and select create a user
give the user a username (rney_terraform_iam) and select for programmatic access 
when creating new user, create group for EC2 perms:
 ec2-group
add a tag key called "project" (this is case sensative), and a value of project name - in this case 'amos'
download access key and secret key
assign rney_terraform_iam to ec2-group if not already done - this can be done through the permissions header under the user

#create key pair under "Security credentials" for terraform
amos_kp
download key pair and save it somewhere safe!
amos_kp.pem
chmod 600 amos_kp.pem

#create .tf file, and put access and secret key in there
framework should look like the amos.tf file

#create instances with terraform
terraform plan
terraform apply

#find your instance public IP
grep public_dns terraform.tfstate

#connect to your instance
ssh -i amos_kp.pem <IP> -l ec2-user
exit

#remove your instances to stop spending money/time
terraform destroy
